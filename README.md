# Java Generics Exercises 🚀

Welcome to the **Java Generics Exercises** project! This project was developed using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and uses only plain Java (no Maven or Gradle). The code is written in Java using the **JBR17** version.

---

## 📖 Description

This project contains two exercises to help you learn and practice abstractions with generics.

### **Exercise 1: NoGenericMethods**

- **Task:**  
  Create a class called `NoGenericMethods` that stores three arguments of the same type. The class should include methods to store and retrieve these objects, and a constructor to initialize all three attributes.  
- **Goal:**  
  Confirm that the arguments can be passed in any order when calling the constructor.

### **Exercise 2: Person and GenericMethods**

- **Task:**  
  1. Create a class called `Person` with the attributes: `name`, `surname`, and `age`.  
  2. Create another class called `GenericMethods` that contains a generic method which accepts three parameters of generic types.  
  3. This generic method should simply print the arguments it receives to the console.
- **Usage Example:**  
  In the main class, call the generic method with different parameter types (e.g., an object of type `Person`, a `String`, and a primitive type) to demonstrate that the method accepts any type and any order of parameters.
